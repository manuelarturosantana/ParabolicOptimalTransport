#Hello!
This file contains, or will contain, both jupyter notebooks and python files
containing the numerical approximators. It will require at least numpy, but 
also matplotlib, imageo, and latex inorder to fully utilize the graphing
capabilities.
SimpleSolution contains a well explained version of the program that simply
returns the solution to the optimal transport problem ran to a tolerance, (but
not the optimal map). 
The solutionWithGraphing folder contains what is needed to be able to both 
calculate the solution up to a tolerance, and also to be able to graph the
solution, and the first and second spacial derivatives, as well as
make color maps.
