# ParabolicOptimalTransport
This code is a numerical analysis of a parabolic optimal transport problem done during the SURIEM REU at Michigan State University.
It is published in conjuction with the paper from the REU. It allows you to 
calcuate a solution to the optimal transport problem in good time using centered
and forward finite difference approximations. Built into the code is the 
stability analysis from the paper, and should be able to handle any two
smoth functions bounded way from zero that are given, and even most piecewise
functions that are bounded away from zero. If there are questions about the 
code or the paper feel free to email me at thanks!
